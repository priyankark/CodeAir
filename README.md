## Security Considerations

- The AirCodum server operates on your local network. Use caution when using it on public networks.
- Ideally avoid using this system over untrusted public networks (say Airport WiFi)
- Your OpenAI API key is stored locally. Never share this key or commit it to version control.
- Be mindful when executing commands from external devices, as they have control over your VS Code instance.
- Regularly update AirCodum and VS Code to ensure you have the latest security patches.
- Review files received through AirCodum before opening or executing them.
- Note: The system doesn't yet support WSS (WebSockets over HTTPS).

## Troubleshooting

- **Can't start the server**: Make sure no other application is using the same port. Try changing the port in settings.
- **Can't connect from other devices**: Ensure all devices are on the same network. Check if any firewall is blocking the connection.
- **AI features not working**: Verify that you've entered a valid OpenAI API key in the settings.
- **File transfer issues**: Check if your WebSocket client is correctly configured to connect to the AirCodum server address.
- **Extension not loading**: Try uninstalling and reinstalling the extension. Ensure your VS Code is up to date.

### **Notice** 
Due to a 'Cease and Desist' letter from an entity called codeair.in that wants to claim CodeAir as a TM (that by the way had no legal grounding: they don't own this TM), the author has decided to change the name of the project from 'CodeAir' to 'AirCodum' to avoid further drama.
